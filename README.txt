This Library has been compiled with Desmet C 2.51 

It can be used to compile Programs on and for the ATARI Portfolio.
Building the Library fails on the Portfolio, but binding it into 
Programs works.
It supports many of the INT61h Extended BIOS functions of the 
Portfolio, as well as some DOS Calls and a BIOS Call to get the 
Memory size.
Maybe it is usefull for someone ...
